# Todos
- [] Refactor all component file name to lowercase (cuz it seems it will cause many problems in both IDE and even on Github)

- [] Verify the site still work in the mobile breakpoint
- [] Design repo README
- [] Setup GA
- [] Exclude the things I don't want people to see
- [] Render the site's changelog on the site and on github
- [] Formalize site's versioning workflow
- Argos:
  - test some indendent Recipe components: Date Picker and Range Picker
- Nice to have
  - [] Some places use flat component which is still an experimental component, so the refactoring might need to be performed there
