/**
 * ðŸ”¥ Below describe how a list component is designed, which highly affects how you think and use such component.
 *
 * You may ask: "then why it needs to even be descirbed?"
 * Because, intuitively, this component is by far the most sophisticated one in the entire project;
 * the source code is very little here, but it packs enormous amount of concepts,
 * (again, this is really intuitive if you consider the sophistication by just linking the amount of code)
 * and since the apporach of our list component is entire different from all the UI libs on the market,
 * it worths to have few words.
 *
 * Let's dive in!
 *
 * A list is overwhelming common in the real world, so some libs provide the encapsulated components for that,
 * but the problem is, such component is also extremely flexible on the style side,
 * > If this reminds you the incrediably flexibility of a card component, you're on the right track!
 * > Just a side note that even the flexibility of a list is far less than a card,
 * > but the possible styles of a list (mostly of the list item) are still very diverse,
 * > and such level of flexibility implies the fact that, you really can't assume too much about the defaults,
 * > otherwise it'd only hurt the DX in many cases (ie., devs need to do lots of css-resetting)
 * so in many times, using such encapsulation can lead to lots of css-resetting or/and hacks.
 *
 *
 * The right way to design a list component is highly sophisticated, cuz it's very different from the design philosophy of the other components.
 * The design approach can be divided into 2 parts:
 *
 * 1) Component Design
 * The biggest reason is because, a list item is just like a card component, although the usage patterns of a list item is quite narrow comparing to a card component,
 * but the possible styles of that still very diverse, that implies that, we can only provide a bare minimum default styles, and leave the rest to the consumer.
 *
 * Providing non-minimal default styles will lead to lots of css-resetting in some (or many) cases, which hurts DX incredibly.
 * So not providing the defaults like padding, border and/or hover is intentional,
 * and the major consequence of using such setup is that, without manual setting padding by the consumer side, the result will look ugly.
 * But again, that's intentional.
 *
 *
 * 2) Sample Code
 * Probably only this component will considered the provided sample codes is actually part of the design.
 * But in fact, this is how we can make our encapsulation simple while still demostrating how to create a versatile list.
 * This is very different from a card component, even though both have extreme high flexibility,
 * but the usage patterns of a list are still quite narrow comparing to a card component,
 * and that's why providing the same codes making sense to be part of the design.
 * - the integration examples of with common components: dropdown, collapsible, and tooltip
 * - the varsatility of how a list component can be used
 *    - this one is literally for demo and review purpose
 * - the common scenarios
