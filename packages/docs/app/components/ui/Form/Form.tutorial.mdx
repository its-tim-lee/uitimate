# Tutorial 1: Firebase App Registration
Let's first take a look of what we gonna build just visually:

<VersatileTabs2 defaultValue="form-firebase-register-app">
  <VersatileTabs2Content value="form-firebase-register-app" demoId="form-firebase-register-app" caption="I don't suggest you to review the corresponding code at least now." />
</VersatileTabs2>

It looks damn simple from the surface, right? But it's not in terms of the implementation complexity.
To be fair, it's quite complicated!

It's in fact, however, a great example to show how to build a complex form with RHF in the right way!

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ RHF's `form` & `formState`
If you are really heavily playing the demo incredibly carefully in many scenarios,
you will find out lots of states are going on in the background; to well control those states,
we need to access RHF's `form` and [`formState`](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useform/formstate) by using `setForm` and `setFormState` props on the `<Form>`:

> Note: we use [`useForm`](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useform) under the hood, and `form` is just the return value from that.

```tsx
const [form, setForm] = useState(undefined);
const [formState, setFormState] = useState(undefined);
// ...
<Form
  setForm={setForm}
  setFormState={setFormState}
  // ...
>
```

If you're experienced with RHF, you might already know `formState` can be accessed from `form`,
but in fact the `formState` getting from that way is different than what we're doing here (yeah, shocking),
so you can't do so, otherwise things will break.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ The challengs

- Async validation/Schema
- Disabling state control
- ...

WIP...

(this tutorial is just fu*king hard to write, and I'm just still working on it, but in the mean time, you can review the code yourself in the demo üòÇ)

# Tutorial 2: Stripe Payment Method
<VersatileTabs2 defaultValue="stripe-payment-method">
  <VersatileTabs2Content value="stripe-payment-method" demoId="stripe-payment-method" caption="I don't suggest you to review the corresponding code at least now." />
</VersatileTabs2>
WIP....
- Different validation scenarios (onBlur, onChange)
- RHF: global error handling (serverError)
- Mask
  - how it makes error handling & schema declaration just easier
