<DefinitionSection id='sidebar'>
The word "sidebar" actually has at least 2 different meanings:
* A context, or
* A physical card (representing the "sidebar" shape)

Physically, a sidebar is just a card, plain and simple.
But since it's called "sidebar", people obviously use this "card" in fewer ways compared to a generic card.

These "fewer ways" usually boil down to:
- How does the sidebar affect surrounding elements?
- What stuff usually goes inside a sidebar?

Those can be answered by literally looking at how people use sidebars:

- Outside the sidebar:
  - When sidebar appears, it might or might not change the size of nearby elements (e.g., floating sidebars usually don't mess with other stuff).
  - Sidebars can be always visible or hideable.
  - On desktop, sidebars are almost always vertical (horizontal sidebars are super rare).
  - On mobile, sidebars can slide in from any edge (top, right, bottom, left), though top is uncommon.
  - You can have multiple sidebars, but usually just 2, and rarely more than 2 visible at once. Even pages with >2 sidebars often only show extras in specific situations.
  - There are no strict rules on how sidebars stack or how the next/previous one appears.
  - That's pretty much it. Probably no other major patterns.

- Inside the sidebar:
  - Lists are almost always there, but besides that, no other patterns are super fixed or common. People can put pretty much anything inside.
  - Just because lists are common doesn't mean it's *not* a sidebar without them!

These patterns only happen in certain contexts, so it's important to name the context. Let's just call it "sidebar (context)".

Make sure you fully get [the definition](definition) first! Otherwise, you might get lost reading this, as it uses concepts explained there.

Our sidebar component has 3 family members:
- `<SidebarLayout>`
  - Usually contains exactly 2 children: `<Sidebar>` and `<SidebarPeer>`.
  - Handles the core logic of the "sidebar context".
- `<Sidebar>`
  - High-level view: Think of it as just a card within the sidebar context. Nothing fancy.
  - Since it's just a card, put whatever you want inside. No limits.
- `<SidebarPeer>`
  - The name says it all. It's the `<Sidebar>`'s peer. The boring one.
  - Typically holds your app's main content, but honestly, you can put anything here.

Before diving deeper, let's play with a simple demo and peek at the code:
<VersatileTabs2 defaultValue="preview-sidebar-toggle-control" compact>
  <VersatileTabs2Content value="preview-sidebar-toggle-control" demoId="sidebar-toggle-control" compact />
</VersatileTabs2>

<Banner>
Remember: the default shortcut for toggling the sidebar is `option/alt + b`.

<TrackableSummary id='difference-from-shadcn-sidebar'>**DEEP DIVE**: Noticed this is very different from [**<u>Shadcn</u>**'s Sidebar](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/sidebar)?</TrackableSummary>

  Yep, sharp eye!

  Again, everything in our sidebar component stems from [the definition](definition),
  which is really just common sense / practical observations.

  Without a solid spec, component design goes wrong.
  It might look cool initially, but can lead to disaster later.

#### 1️⃣ The Sidebar

Our `<Sidebar>` uses [@uitimate/drawer](./../../drawer/introduction) (we call it the "mobile sidebar")
on small screens. This leads to these scenarios:

1. You only want a desktop sidebar (i.e., it looks the same on all screen sizes).
2. You just want to use our solution regardless.
3. Other cases are probably rare or have straightforward solutions.

The first case is covered next. Here's what you need for the 2nd case:

Any prop or class you pass to `<Sidebar>` gets forwarded to *both* the desktop and mobile sidebars (FYI: the desktop sidebar is just a styled `div`).

Since mobile and desktop sidebar layouts often differ, our policy is: when using `<Sidebar>`, you MUST explicitly define the inner layout for each using
`<Sidebar.Mobile>` and `<Sidebar.Desktop>`:

<VersatileTabs2 defaultValue="sidebar-rwd-minimum-demo" compact>
  <VersatileTabs2Content
    value="sidebar-rwd-minimum-demo"
    demoId="sidebar-rwd-minimum-demo"
    caption="Resize the viewport to see the mobile sidebar (of course, pressing `option/alt + b`)"
    compact
  />
</VersatileTabs2>

<Banner>
  As the code snippet shows, you MUST also include `<DrawerHeader>` inside `<Sidebar.Mobile>`.
  Wondering why, or why `<Sidebar.Mobile>` & `<Sidebar.Desktop>` even exist? Check the source code!
</Banner>

#### 2️⃣ The SidebarLayout
This component does most of the heavy lifting (more on that later) to make the sidebar work smoothly.
Let's cover some key points, starting with case #1 from the previous section.

It's actually the easiest: just set `enableMobileSidebar={false}` on `<SidebarLayout>`
(then you don't need `<Sidebar.Mobile>` or `<Sidebar.Desktop>` anymore).

<VersatileTabs2 defaultValue="sidebar-toggle-control" id="no-mobile-sidebar-demo" compact>
  <VersatileTabs2Content
    value="sidebar-toggle-control"
    demoId="sidebar-toggle-control"
    showCodeFirst={true}
    compact
  />
</VersatileTabs2>
Now, placement: where should `<Sidebar>` go inside `<SidebarLayout>`? This only matters for desktop:
```tsx file="components/ui/Sidebar/Sidebar.anatomy.txt"
```
After placing it, you MUST declare the directions for both desktop and mobile sidebars using the mandatory `directions` prop on `<SidebarLayout>`.
Here's the **TypeScript** definition (check the [previous demo](no-mobile-sidebar-demo) for an example):

```ts
  directions: [
    desktopSidebarDirection: "left" | "right",
    mobileSidebarDirection?: "left" | "right" | "top" | "bottom"
  ]
```
<br />

<details>
<TrackableSummary id='difference-from-shadcn-sidebar'>**DEEP DIVE**: The placement and `directions` seem kinda redundant?</TrackableSummary>

    Yeah, a bit.

    But many sidebar libraries require a similar prop.
    Why? Auto-detecting direction makes the component code way too complex and unreliable.

    Plus, explicitly setting the mobile sidebar direction makes sense, since it often differs from the desktop direction (pretty common, actually).

    Since you *have* to specify the mobile direction anyway, why not just declare both together? It makes both directions super explicit and clear!

    Seen this way, still think it's redundant?

For other props and concepts, check out these demos and their code snippets:
<VersatileTabs2 defaultValue="sidebar-in-dialog">
  <VersatileTabs2List>
    <VersatileTabs2Trigger value="sidebar-in-dialog">In Dialog</VersatileTabs2Trigger>
    <VersatileTabs2Trigger value="sidebar-two">2 Sidebars</VersatileTabs2Trigger>
    <VersatileTabs2Trigger value="sidebar-youtube">Youtube</VersatileTabs2Trigger>
  </VersatileTabs2List>
  <VersatileTabs2Content
    value="sidebar-in-dialog"
    demoId="sidebar-in-dialog"
    compact
    >
  - `defaultOpen`: ONLY for desktop sidebars. Who wants a mobile sidebar open by default, right?
  - `variant=flat`: The basic, kinda boring style. It just means the sidebar and its peer are visually on the same level.
  </VersatileTabs2Content>
  <VersatileTabs2Content
    value="sidebar-two"
    demoId="sidebar-two"
    compact
    >
  - Note: We've customized the shortcut for different sidebar layouts (using [hotkeys-js](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/hotkeys-js)).
  - The style difference between the 2 variants is basically which one appears "higher" from your eye-level view.
  </VersatileTabs2Content>
  <VersatileTabs2Content
    value="sidebar-youtube"
    demoId="sidebar-youtube"
    compact
    >
    Go check out YouTube. Pay VERY close attention to how their sidebar transitions during breakpoint changes. Toggle it on/off while resizing and just watch!

    This example shows you can totally replicate that!

    Why? Because our sidebar component does a ton of the heavy lifting for you!

    <QA2Trigger id='multiple-sidebar-in-sidebar-layout'>Can I put more than one `<Sidebar>` or `<SidebarPeer>` in `<SidebarLayout>`?</QA2Trigger>
     <QA2Content>
        You can! But it breaks the implementation policy and might cause issues!

        You might think that's a design limitation, but honestly, it's not.
You're only looking at it from the consumer side; the design considers more.

        Let's repeat the policy: Only ONE `<Sidebar>` and ONE `<SidebarPeer>` per `<SidebarLayout>`.

         "Why?" you ask.

         I can't cover *all* the details here (that'd be a whole article!), but here are the main points:

        1. It's rarely a problem for consumers. You can nest `<SidebarLayout>` inside `<SidebarPeer>`. Usually, nested sidebars aren't super deep or numerous because complex UIs like that are rare.

        2. Handling multiple `<Sidebar>` elements in `<SidebarLayout>` makes the source code unnecessarily complex and brittle.
