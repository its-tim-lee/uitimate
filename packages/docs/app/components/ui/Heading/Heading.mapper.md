From your received Figma JSON data, you should be able to analyze out the properties of the component as something like:

```
{
  Size: 'h1',
  Title: 'Vision',
  Subtitle: 'Learn how to use vision capabilities.',
}
```

Which can be mapped to the Code Component:

```tsx
<Heading size="h1">
  <HeadingTitle>Vision</HeadingTitle>
  <HeadingSubtitle>
    Learn how to use vision capabilities.
  </HeadingSubtitle>
</Heading>
```
