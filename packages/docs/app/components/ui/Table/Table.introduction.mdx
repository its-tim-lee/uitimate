Our table family components are just a minimal theme wrapper over the native HTML table elements,
the source code is quite straight and simple, so I would just recommend you to adhead to the [API reference page](./../api)
to see how to use it with **TanStack Table**.

    <QA2Trigger>Why don't encapsulate **<u>TanStack Table</u>**?</QA2Trigger>
     <QA2Content>
       You might see us of encapsulating RHF (**React Hook Form**) in our [form component](./../../form/introduction),
       but that doesn't mean that one should always do the encapsulation for this kind of headless UI things.

       In fact, whether to do so is still somewhat related to how a headless UI framework is designed.

       Basically, besides providing hooks, RHF also offers few React components.
       By directly using RHF, it would require us to set up non-trivial boilerplate code, especially in the building of complicated forms,
       but most importantly, it would seriously affect how smooth one could use whatever form components in the composition fashion,
       and that's why encapsulation is needed.

       **TanStack Table**, however, basically just provides hooks. There's not much benefit for the consumer to use the encapsulated version of it and being more productive.
