Our table family components are just minimal theme wrappers over native HTML table elements.
The source code is straightforward and simple, so I recommend heading to the [API reference page](./../api)
to see how to use it with **TanStack Table**.

    <QA2Trigger>Why don't we encapsulate **<u>TanStack Table</u>**?</QA2Trigger>
     <QA2Content>
       You might see us encapsulating RHF (**React Hook Form**) in our [form component](./../../form/introduction),
       but that doesn't mean we should always encapsulate headless UI frameworks.

       It really depends on how the headless UI framework is designed.

       RHF provides hooks and a few React components. Using RHF directly requires setting up non-trivial boilerplate code,
       especially for complex forms. More importantly, it would impact how smoothly you can use form components in a compositional way -
       that's why encapsulation makes sense there.

       **TanStack Table**, however, mainly provides hooks. There's little benefit for users with an encapsulated version, and it won't make you 10x more productive.
