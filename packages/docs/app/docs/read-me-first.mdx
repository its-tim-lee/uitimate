## Setup **Uitimate**

Unlike **shadcn/ui**, our setup is much easier and requires almost no installation steps.
You're ready to go as long as you have:
1) a React-based project (e.g., **Next.js**, **Remix**, etc.),
2) **TypeScript**, and
3) **Tailwind CSS** v4 enabled.

We've prepared a [starter project](https://github.com/its-tim-lee/uitimate/tree/main/packages/examples/uitimate-starter) for you. However, you should still review all the content and follow the setup steps below, as some parts of our setup differ significantly from traditional "installation" or "configuration" processes you may have seen in other documentation.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp; Configure path alias in your project

By default, our component source code and many demo examples use file paths like:
```ts
import ... from "#/..."
```
Here, `#` is an alias that must be configured in advance for our code to work in your project.

<details className="tw:cursor-pointer">
<TrackableSummary id="setup__why-this-alias-symbol">**DEEP DIVE**: Why `#`? Why not `@`?</TrackableSummary>
<div className="tw:pl-4">
  Using `#` is actually the best practice, because it leverages **Node.js**'s native subpath imports ‚éØ
  entries in the "imports" field of your package.json must start with `#` to distinguish them from package names,
  so `import foo from '#src/foo.js'` works out of the box across **Node.js**, test runners, and bundlers, without plugins or polyfills.

  In contrast, @-based aliases (e.g. `@/src`) must be manually configured for each tool ‚éØ
  **Vite** requires explicit setup in the configuration file (and matching paths in tsconfig.json),
  while **Webpack**, **ESLint**, and others similarly demand custom overrides.

  Additionally, `@` overlaps with npm's scoped-package syntax (`@scope/pkg`),
  but `#` is reserved for internal subpath imports and can't clash with external packages,
  ensuring consistent resolution and a unified setup across your entire toolchain
  (i.e., you can now also use `#` in your build tool configuration files without hassle!)

  Since using `#` is best practice, we currently don't consider using any other symbol in our code and setup.

</details>

Now follow the steps below to set up the corresponding files:

<details className="tw:cursor-pointer">
<TrackableSummary id="setup__tsconfig-instruction">tsconfig.json</TrackableSummary>
  <div>
  Usually you will have this configuration file for the **TypeScript**, but the name can be slightly different (e.g., maybe it's called `tsconfig.app.json`) depending on your choice of scaffolding tool (e.g., **Vite**, **Webpack**, ‚Ä¶).
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "paths": {
        "#/*": ["app/*"], // doesn't need to be `app`, you may change it to whatever you want (e.g., `src`)
        // ...
      },
      // ...
    },
    // ...
  }
  ```
  </div>
</details>

<details className="tw:cursor-pointer">
<TrackableSummary id="setup__build-tool-instruction">the build tool configuration file</TrackableSummary>
  <div className="tw:pl-4">
  This means that you're using something like **Vite** or **Webpack**, so you need to tell it what `#` means to allow it to analyze and/or compile correctly. Below is an example for **Vite**, but this is extremely common and easy to do in all other build tools:
  ```ts
  // ...
  import tsconfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";
  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
      // ...
      tsconfigPaths()
    ],
    // ....
  });
  ```
  </div>
</details>

<details className="tw:cursor-pointer">
<TrackableSummary id="setup__package-json-instruction">package.json</TrackableSummary>
<div>
  ```json
  {
    "imports": {
      "#/*": "./app/*" // doesn't need to be `app`, you may change it to whatever you want (e.g., `src`)
      // ...
    },
    // ...
  }
  ```
  </div>
</details>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp; Configure path preferences on this site

Many of our code examples use specific import paths (see below). If these paths don't match your local setup, it can be a hassle to use our code without refactoring.

Currently, there're only two path preferences (and probably won't have more in the future), so please follow the instructions below to ensure they match your local environment setup:

<HelpersPathSection />

<ComponentsPathSection />

<br/>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp; Download base dependencies
Since our code uses some dependencies under the hood, you need to install them in your project:

<TerminalCommandInstructor cli="npm add @tailwindcss/typography tailwind-merge tailwind-variants tailwindcss-animate lodash-es change-case clsx" />

<br/>

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp; Configure **Tailwind**
Make sure you've set up **Tailwind CSS v4** in your project, and copy the following configuration into a CSS file.
You can choose where to place and import this file, but it must be included in your project (typically, it should be imported in your application's entry file).
Otherwise, all our components will not be styled correctly.

<DirtyFixCodeBlock id="core-css" />

<br />

<Banner>
Notice that we use the prefix `tw` in the code above (short for **Tailwind**), which we recommend as best practice: all your **Tailwind** classes should be used by prepending `tw:` (e.g., `tw:text-center`).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp; Party time &nbsp; üéâ
Now, just head to any of our component pages to explore. If you want to use a component, go to its setup page and follow the instructions.
You're ready to start using **Uitimate**!
