## TL;DR

#### Short answer

**Uitimate** is the next generation of UI component library authoring.

#### Longer answer

It's a replacement for [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) with major improvements to greatly enhance DX through engineering best practices and new innovations.

You can use it to build your design system or develop UI faster and more easily. It solves the dilemma of choosing between traditional component libraries (e.g., **MUI**) and headless ones (e.g., **Radix**).


## Motivation

The ultimate goal is to enable [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) for UI development directly from **Figma**, integrating your existing component library in the codebase. Depending on your experience, you might be surprised by the relationship between that goal and **Uitimate**.

Frankly, building UIs REALLY, REALLY SUCKS ⎯ and even feels pointless in this AI era. While AI tends to prefer component libraries that aren't published on NPM (We call this "VPM": Virtual Package Management, which is adopted by **Uitimate** and **shadcn/ui**), we're still far from the goal we just mentioned.

So we're building an AI system ⎯ a visual CMS that lets developers, without coding, auto-replicate UI from **Figma** by interacting with AI, without many of the limitations imposed by big players (e.g., **Builder.io**) in this field. Our "major improvements" over **shadcn/ui** are actually a necessary part of the infrastructure for this system.

**Uitimate** is public (where the AI system is currently private):

- You don't suffer from the dilemma ⎯ [the pain](https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2025/04/22/ui-component-libraries-shadcn-ui-and-the-revenge-of-copypasta/) of using a traditional component library, or being overwhelmed by the complexity and workload of building one based on a headless library from scratch. The VPM approach is actually the starting point of the beauty from the balance.

- The overall software design quality of **Uitimate** should be great enough to make development delightful, without lots of hassles compared to using **shadcn/ui**.

- You'll learn how to truly make the component library "scalable" for both humans and AI: this topic deserves some discussion (actually, it's really big!) because it not only involves relevant new concepts around VPM but also includes ML basics, which are rarely talked about.


## The vision
**Uitimate** is currently an innovative component library, and it will always be open source. Ultimately, it will become a platform integrated with AI and a visual CMS that helps developers enjoy UI development while spending time on something more meaningful.
