# What it’s?

### Short answer

Uitimate is the next generation of UI component library authoring.

### Longer answer

It’s the replacement of [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) with big improvements to greatly enhance DX in terms of engineering best practices & new innovations.

You may use it to build your design system, or just use it to develop UI faster and easier: It’s the solution of the dilemma on choosing component library types: traditional (eg., MUI) or headless (eg., Radix).

# Why created it?

Being able to do Vibe Coding on UI development from Figma with the integration on the existing codebase is the ultimate goal. Depends on you experience, you might surprise on the relationship between that goal and Uitimate.

Frankly, building UI REALLY REALLY SUCKS and even is stupid in this AI era. Despite AI quite likes the component library that doesn’t be published on NPM (note: I called it “VPM” : Virtual Package Management), it’s still far away from the goal I just mentioned.

So I’m building a AI system  ⎯  A visual CMS that a developer can replicate the UI from Figma by interacting with machine without coding, and at the same time, doesn’t have the limitations from the big players (eg., Builder.io) in the same field. The big improvements from [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) is actually the necessary part of the infrastructure in the system.

I think that it’d be extremely helpful for people to use Uitimate directly even without the help from AI, because…

- I gonna greatly clarify many things from the field of UI component development: there’re actually quite of concepts in the existing old fashion that really need to be explained well, not to mention the pioneer move of VPM from [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui); people really are bad at sinking-in the new paradigm quickly, so they often ask questions / misunderstand on the new paradigm using the outdated / old (fashion) knowledge, which in many cases, don’t make sense at all
- The overall software design quality should be already good enough from Uitimate that should just make you delightful to develop with. So basically no major hassles from using [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) in our case.
