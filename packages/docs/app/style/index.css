/**
 * This is literally for better code organization. But there's a concept worth to be mentioned:
 * Baiscally, it's about how Tailwind v4 deals with traditional style scoping (eg., CSS modules, or the local style provided by frameworks like Vue)
 * In fact, Tailwind does offer an API `@reference` to reference the global style to the local CSS,
 * and by doing so, you're be able to do whatever you like as you did in the global CSS without worrying about Tailwind get loaded more than once.
 *
 * But importing that local CSS into the local component can lead to performance issue (see https://bitl.to/4Emz),
 * and that's why we instead import them into the global.
