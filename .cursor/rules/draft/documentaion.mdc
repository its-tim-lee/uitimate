- Grammatically correct

- Make the content concise, short, and easier to understand:
  - Strategy A: if there is a chance to replace some of it into "number" , you should do so
    - eg., "completely sure" may be replaced by "100% sure".
  - You may come up with other strategies

- Make the content as a popular developer-focus article:
  - Do not make it like a formal essay
  - Make it more like an extreme popular Medium-like post
  - Using internet wordings if applicable (eg., TLDR;)
