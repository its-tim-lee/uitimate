# Figma to Code Implementation Guidelines
!!!!!
When implementing Figma designs to code, follow these strict rules based on the Figma layer data you receive.

## Terminology
- **Layer**: A single element in the Figma design (can be a frame, component, text, etc.)
- **Figma Component**: A layer in Figma with name wrapped in angle brackets (e.g., "<Calendar>")
- **Code Component**: All the first directories under packages/docs/app/components/ui are Code components

## Data Structure
The Figma data comes in JSON format with this structure:
```json
{
  "metadata": {},
  "nodes": [],
  "globalVars": {}
}
```
Every layer in the "nodes" array has essential attributes:
- "name": this determines implementation approach
- "type": this affects implementation requirements

## Implementation Cases
To implement any layer, STRICTLY follow either one below:

### CASE-A: Regular Layers
**When**: Layer name is plain text (e.g., "Calendar", "Button")
**How**: 
- Implement this specific layer using only HTML elements and Tailwind classes, you do NOT ALLOW to use any Code component to implement
- For child layers (if any): see whether it follows which Implementation Rules

### CASE-B: Figma Component Layers
**When**: Layer name is wrapped in angle brackets (e.g., "<Calendar>", "<Icon>")
**How**:
Find out the corresponding Code Component by:
   - 1. Use your internal tool `list_dir` to check available components
   - 2. If a specific directory is found, make sure to read all the files under that (including all the relevant files specified on the import statements in those files if any)
   - 3. If no found, escalate to user before proceeding
**Note**
- Never fallback to raw HTML implementation

#### Sub-cases:
- **CASE-B-1** (type="INSTANCE"):
  - Code Component MUST be implemented exactly as shown in Figma Component
  - No visual deviations allowed
  
- **CASE-B-2** (typeâ‰ "INSTANCE"):
  - Try to match Figma Component design as closely as possible using Code Component
  - Document any unavoidable visual differences

## Implementation Rules
- Never duplicate visual elements that the Code Component already provides

## Implementation Steps
1. Get the layer info from the Figma layer data
2. Check "Implementation Cases" to see how to implement that layer
3. Once done, go back to step 1 if any layer hasn't been implemented yet
