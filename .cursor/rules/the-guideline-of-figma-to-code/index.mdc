# Figma to Code Implementation Guidelines

STRICTLY Follow instrutions below based on the Figma data you receive:

## Data Structure
The Figma data comes in JSON format with this structure:
```json
{
  "metadata": {},
  "nodes": [],
  "globalVars": {}
}
```
Any element in the "nodes" array is called a Figma layer, and it has essential attributes "name" and "type" that will affect your approach to implement (more on this later).

Figma layers in "nodes" are in hierarchy, and they stack in this fashion: the first and the only child of "nodes" is the root layer, then root layer might have children layers, and each child layer might have the dedicated children layers, and it goes on and on. If this is not the case, you should warn me and stop any your process.

## Terminology
- **Layer**: A Figma layer
- **Figma Component**: A layer with the name wrapped in angle brackets (eg., "<Calendar>")
- **Regular Layer**: The opposite of Figma Component － a layer with the name but not in angle brackets (eg., "Calendar")
- **Code Component**: All the first directories under packages/docs/app/components/ui are Code components

## Implementation Cases
To implement any layer, follow either one below:

### CASE-A: Regular Layer
Implement it using only HTML elements and Tailwind classes

### CASE-B: Figma Component
**How**:
Find out the corresponding Code Component by:

   - 1. Use your internal tool `list_dir` to check available components

   - 2. If a specific directory is found, make sure to read all the files under that
     At this step, you must show me that the list of all the files you've read,
     including all the relevant files specified on the import statements in those files if any,
     if any one is missed to read, you do NOT ALLOWED to move to the next step!

   - 3. If no found, escalate to user before proceeding

**Note**
- Never fallback to raw HTML implementation

#### Sub-cases:
- **CASE-B-1** (type="INSTANCE"):
  Code Component MUST be implemented exactly as shown in Figma Component (ie., No visual deviations allowed)

- **CASE-B-2** (type≠"INSTANCE"):
  - Try to match Figma Component design as closely as possible using Code Component
  - Document any unavoidable visual differences

## Implementation Steps
0. Make sure review all the rules below, and alwasy respect them during your implementation
  - Never duplicate visual elements that the Code Component already provides
  - [project-react-component-development-guideline.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-react-component-development-guideline.mdc)
1. Get the layer info from the Figma data
2. Check "Implementation Cases" to see how to implement that layer
3. Once checked, go back to step 1 for each child layer
