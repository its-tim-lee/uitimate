- All the component's name, and any type in the file must be in upper camel case
- All the components' name must start with the same identifier (eg., In the heading component, there're: Heading, HeadingTitle, and HeadingSubtitle)
- A props type of a component must be named in the form of "ComponentNameProps" (eg., A component "Heading" has a props type "HeadingProps")
- Only React v19 syntax should be used (eg., do not usse `forwardRef`)
- When declare any component type, if you can use `ComponentProps`, do not use `HTMLAttributes`
- The name of a variant (declared via tailwind-variant) must be in lower camel case, and the ending of the name must be "Variants"
- All the types in the file should be aggregated in `namespace` under below pattern:
  ```
  namespace Type {
    export type ComponentName = ComponentNameProps;
    // ...
  }
  ```
- All the family components must define `displayName` which literally just points to the name of the corresponding component
- Each component must have data-tag with the value to its `displayName` but in kebab case using lodash-es's kebabCase
- Each component must declare type for its props
- All the components, variants, React contexts should be exported
- Among all the types in the file, only `namespace Type` will be exported
- There's only one `export` will be used in the file to export everything that should be exported
- All the React APIs, including the type, should be used without via the namespace `React`
  > eg., instead of using `React.ComponentProps`, use `ComponentProps`
- The code placement follows below rules:
  - from the file bottom to top, it'd be: `export`, `namespace Type`, stacks of displayName
  - the type of component's props will be placed just right before the component


=========== WIP
- The folder structure: 
  - doc
  - mapper
  - ...
- In most of time, `asChild` should be supported in each component
- When any source code change, check whether there's anything (eg., comment, stories, doc, ...) needs to be updated as well:
  - all other files under the same folder (eg., doc, storybook)
  - all other files that use the source code
  If making the update is uncertain, warn me
