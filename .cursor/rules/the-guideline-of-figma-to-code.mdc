You should already recive the Figma layer representation Ôºç a json-like data usually with the shape:
```
{
"metadata": {},
"nodes": [],
"globalVars": {}
}
```
"nodes" contains the real layers, and the first, the only element should be a root layer.

Every layer will have root attributes such as "name", "type".

Regarding "name", if its value is in the pattern of <layer-name>, we call this layer as Figma component, which means it's an implemntation of a component from a design system in Figma. Figma component can only be implemented using the corresponding component (we call this as code component) from this project's app/components/ui. 

But there're 2 directions to implement if encountering a Figma component:
- code component -> Figma component : either adjust code component as much as possible to try to replicate the Figma component (it's possible that the 100% replication is impossible, but in many cases, it should be very close)
- code component <- Figma component : or just use the existing style from the code component (in most of time, it'd be just certain kind of code component variation using its props) to partially replicate the Figma component (it's possible that in some cases, the replication result can be very different from the Figma component such as size) 

Which direction to choose, depends on the value of attribute "type". If the value is "INSTANCE", the approach "code component -> Figma component" must be choosed if it's a Figma component, otherwise you should ask me before any coding.

But when encountering a non-Figma component, while no code component can be used, you should try very hard to implement the same visual outlook result as the layer.

During your replication, you should use all this project's available tools, such as Tailwind (including its setup file: app/style/index.css), the components in app/components/ui. This means that you must fully understand how to use the corresponding code component, including, but not limit to all its source code and the corresponding Storybook stories. This also implies the sense-making facts such as: (after review these facts, you should figure out all other possible facts yourself)
- If the code component has implemented some visual items that happen to be very similar as the ones shown on the Figma component, then you shouldn't implement that visual items again in using that code component
